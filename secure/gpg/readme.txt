This location contains the backup of gpg key.
Script will restore or auto import this key if C_GPG_USE_EXISTING_KEY is set to true

The file should have the following name:

gpg_private_key.gpg

The file should be encrypted initially as .gpg and you also need to provide decryption password in C_GPG_PASSPHRASE.
If C_GPG_PASSPHRASE password does not match, this will produce error and you should create new key by using:

C_GPG_USE_EXISTING_KEY=false
